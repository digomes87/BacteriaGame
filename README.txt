Welcome to Screen Bacteria - a Ludum Dare 31 Entry
———————————————————————————————————————————————

As for now, to run the game, you will need to install
python 2.7.x and pygame (sorry…)

Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/
pygame : http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

(choose the most recent links corresponding to your version)

Once installed, to run the game just double click on intro.py
Thanks for testing !!
